/// Calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer.
/// 
/// # Arguments
/// 
/// * `n` - A non-negative integer whose factorial is to be computed.
/// 
/// # Returns
/// 
/// * The factorial of the input integer as a `u64`.
/// 
/// # Panics
/// 
/// * If `n` is greater than 20, this function may panic due to integer overflow.
/// 
/// # Examples
/// 
/// ```
/// let result = factorial(5);
/// assert_eq!(result, 120);
/// ```
